# Ryzentosh-MSI-X470-RX550LEXA-BCM94360CS2

## Introduction

After a long struggle, i was able to run the AMD Radeon RX 550 Lexa graphics card in hackintosh without any problems. Other than that i believe there are different things in my EFI that can help people. Feel happy while using it :)

## Software Compatibility

- Ventura (13.x)
- Monterey (12.x)
- Big Sur (11.x)
- Catalina (10.15.x)

## Important

RX 550 Lexa only works in **(_SB_).(PCI0).(GPP8)** location path on hackintosh. If you have this location path, you are very lucky. Because it will work smoothly.

**Follow these steps to find your location path**
1. Open Windows and go to device manager.
2. Find your graphics card and right click on it and click properties.
3. Click details in the opened tab, then find the device path from the property tab.
4. You will see two values. One will be like this **ACPI(_SB_)#ACPI(PCI0)#ACPI(GPP8)#PCI(0000)**
5. If your location path is as i mentioned, you are lucky. If not, sorry the graphics card will not work.
